# Advent of Code 2021

An attempt for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

2022-03-06: Done up to day 14 inclusive.

* Note that this is based off my earlier attempt at the AoC 2019.
* This was an attempt to begin to use Kotlin's Arrow library. (I have since gotten a bit lazy and strayed from Arrow, even though it is an excellent library.)
